Titanic-disaster-prediction
===========================

In this script, we predict the survivability in the Titanic disaster based on features such as gender, ticket class, family status etc. This is part of a kaggle competition.

1. We load the test and training data sets from the kaggle website.  
2. Preprocessing of the data:  
    * Remove or impute NA values.  
    * Replace ordinal and nominal features with numerical values.  
3. Exploratory data analysis: What does the data look like? Form intuition!   
4. Train a machine learning algorithm.     
5. Test the algorithm.  
6. Try other algorithms and ways to improve them.  

Introduction
------------

We are given a training data set and a test data set. Find out the dimensions of each file. Survival takes on binary values of 0 (die) or 1 (live) and shown as a function of the following features:
