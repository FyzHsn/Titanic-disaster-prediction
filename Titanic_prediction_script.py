In this script, we predict the survivability in the Titanic disaster. This is 
part of a kaggle competition.

1) We load the test and training data sets from the kaggle website.
2) Preprocessing of the data:
    * Remove or impute NA values.
    * Replace ordinal and nominal features with numerical values.
3) Exploratory data analysis: What does the data look like? Form intuition! 
4) Train a machine learning algorithm.    
5) Test the algorithm.
6) Try other algorithms and ways to improve them.
